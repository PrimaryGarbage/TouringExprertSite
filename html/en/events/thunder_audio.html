                        Sound design incorporates VTX V25 arrays as mains, numerous other VTX loudspeakers for a variety of fill needs and VTX subwoofers in the air and on the ground, all driven by Crown amplification.
                    </h4>

                        <a href="http://www.thunderaudioinc.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Audio</a>  (Livonia, MI) recently supported Pitbull’s “Can’t Stop Us Now” tour with <a href="http://jblpro.com/" target="_blank">JBL Professional</a> VTX line array systems and Crown amplifiers in stadiums and amphitheaters across North America.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The artist’s veteran front-of-house engineer Will Madera and production manager Victor Martinez hired Thunder Audio to supply sound reinforcement for for the three-month tour. With the help of Pitbull system engineer and audio crew chief Nick Turner, the audio team selected and designed the JBL-headed system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “I wanted the unique sound that the JBL VTX Series provides,” says Madera. “We needed a system that could simultaneously deliver an urban sound and a pop sound. The VTX system checks all the boxes we were looking for on this tour, which requires me to mix a live band with an urban pop sound. The system response is balanced with plenty of lows, and translates my mix very clearly. I definitely look forward to carrying JBL VTX line arrays on future tours.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The main left-right hangs consisted of 36 JBL VTX V25 array modules (18 boxes per side) joined by 24 VTX A12 loudspeakers as suspended outfills (12 boxes per side), 16 VTX A8 as 270-degree wraparounds (eight per side), and eight VTX A8 for frontfill.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “The V25 speakers are nice as mains because of how much horsepower they provide,” states Turner. “The A8 sounds absolutely stunning. I’m a big fan of the A8 because we can use it as front fills and wraparounds and it blends very well with the mains. The A12s sound great when paired with the B28 subs, which are pretty amazing. Will Madera absolutely loves the system and tells me how great it sounds every night. The great thing about the VTX Series speakers is that I don’t really have to do too much system tuning to make Will happy with the way his mixes are translating, because these speakers sound great right out of the gate. “
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sixteen VTX S28 dual 18-inch arrayable subwoofers (eight subs per side) were flown behind or beside the V25 boxes, depending on the venue’s rigging capabilities, to bolster the low end. Additionally, the Thunder Audio team deployed 24 VTX B28 subwoofers on the floor in front of the stage, arranged in eight cardioid arrays of three boxes each. All loudspeakers were driven with a total of 92 Crown I-Tech 12000HD amplifiers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Turner also utilized JBL Array Link, a mobile companion app that works in conjunction with the company’s latest LAC-III software, dissemminate technical details needed for his team to deploy the arrays for each show, adding, “I want to mention how great it is to have QR codes from the Line Array Calculator software. It saves a tremendous amount of time each day by delivering information to my team precisely using the Array Link app on the phones. The Array Link app provides each fly guy all the details they need to deploy the hangs consistently and efficiently, from point weights, angles, fly bar positions, trim heights and more. I wish other manufacturers had this feature as it makes my job easy every morning and affords me a few minutes of spare time while onsite during the mornings.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Greg Snyder, VP of sales at Thunder Audio, concludes, “Our experience with JBL VTX over the last ten years has proven to be extremely successful,” said Snyder. “The VTX system performs beyond all expectations in every situation we have ever used it in. Thanks to our relationship with HARMAN and the Pitbull team, this tour is a win for Thunder Audio and everyone who has enjoyed the shows. Our touring staff and the artist engineers are the best in the industry.”
