                        At the end of the summer of 2016, news came that caused a lively discussion among specialists close to professional concert sound. Paul Bauman came to the position of product development for touring and rental in the MUSIC company (Music Group). The resonance caused by this event is not surprising, since during his more than 30 years of activity, Paul Bauman managed to work in such large and iconic companies on the market as Adamson, L-Acoustics and JBL, and not just work as one of the effective managers, but as a person involved in the development of flagship products that provided the success of these companies in the market. But about everything in order.

                    <span><b><i>&nbspPaul Bauman</i></b></span>

                    <p>
                        Paul began his career with a purely scientific work as a physicist dealing with the theory of antenna systems, physical modeling and design of monolithic microwave chips. This is what his first works of a young bachelor in physics are dedicated to. But just a few years later, Paul switched to research areas related to acoustics, and in 1983 he became a master in physics for research in the field of digital signal processing of sound reflections using modern mathematical methods of convolution and Cepstrum analysis. In parallel, an active practical activity begins â€“ in the same year he takes part in the development of JBL speakers according to the Lucas THX specification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first serious undertaking of Paul Bauman can be considered a partnership participation in 1991 in the development of the Adamson brand, where he was not only an engineer and developer, but also a co-owner of 30% of the company. After 3 years, Paul went to work for the largest rental company in the United States, Maryland Sound International. During the 4 years spent there as director of research and development of custom products, Paul gained invaluable experience as a system engineer during major tours and festivals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul Bauman's talents were fully realized when he joined L-Acoustics in 1998, where he headed the technical support department, and then the research and development department. Under his leadership, the image of the L-Acoustics product line was formed as we know it now. Among the implemented projects, we can list the flagship systems V-DOSC, dV-DOSC, KUDO, ARCS, 115XT-HiQ, participation in the development of Soundvision software, preparation of presets for the entire line of the company's acoustic systems, establishing partnerships with Lab Gruppen as a supplier of amplifiers according to L-Acoustics specifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next significant milestone is the transition in 2006 to the world's largest corporation Harman Professional, where he headed the division of products for tours and engineering solutions. Here Paul makes a serious contribution to the development of the JBL brand. Under his leadership, such world-famous series as Vertec, VRX, VTX are being produced, ready-made solutions for JBL acoustics and Crown amplification are being developed, the HiQnet control protocol is being actively improved, while Paul is one of the authors of patents for the appearance of new linear arrays, as well as for the software interface and algorithms for controlling audio equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so, since September 2016, Paul Bauman has been moving to the Music Group corporation, which has such brands as Tannoy, Turbosound and Lab Gruppen in its portfolio. Brands are certainly legendary, but they need a new impetus for further development. Of course, now the management of the Music Group is betting on Paul in this matter, who has extensive experience and has not only theoretical knowledge, but is also perfectly familiar with all modern trends in the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It has already been announced that the main activity of Paul Bauman is the formation of the appearance of the entire Turbosound tour line, which will be developed in close integration with the reinforcement from Lab Gruppen and Lake processing. Of course, the creation and launch of new models is not a momentary matter and it is too early to talk about any deadlines for the release of new products. But there is no doubt that they will follow. It is worth admitting that attracting such a specialist to your team is a very strong move on the part of the Music Group. For now, we can only be patient and look forward to the continuation of this story with interest.
